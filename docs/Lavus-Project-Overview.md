## About the Project

### What is "Lavu's"?

"Lavu's" is an online restaurant reservation and loyalty app. You can reserve or pre-order food anywhere, whether at work or driving, just with this app. It also helps you to track great deal and build loyalty with the restaurant. Win-win for customers and the business.

### Problem Statement

There are more and more restaurants and eateries; and the competition is getting fiercer. Creating loyal customers for long-term service is essential to any business. Along with that, always receiving feedback from customers will help us constantly improve the business.

### Possible Solution

Besides the greatest service, it is a wise move to show customers how convenient it is to interact with the restaurant's services and that we always listen to them. "Lavu's" will bring solutions for customers to connect with the restaurant in the most convenient way. Especially for the feature of booking, tracking promotions, fast payment and accumulating bonus points.

### Project Brief

Following a goal-directed design process for this project, I rounded out some key questions that would later help drive my process further.

1. Which group of people would use the product?
2. How can we create a product that's accessible for most people?
3. Which common features will be necessary in the product?

### Discover Phase

In this section, we will take a look at common behaviors between users, and the pattern was observed through user observations and interview.

#### Research Questions

A questionnaire was conducted to gauge experience impact on customers in term of convenience and loyalty, as well as they think and feel during each part of the process.

1. How often do you enjoy food in the restaurant and who do you go with?
2. What is the problem you often encounter when eating at a restaurant?
3. How often do you do food reviewing at a restaurant? When you do, what is your motivation for doing so?
4. How long does it usually take for you to pay and review the food?
5. Can you describe your memorable experiences with dishes choosing and food evaluating after meals in restaurants?
6. What challenges do you usually face in the dishes choosing, reviewing and payment process? How does this make you feel?
7. Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?

#### Key Insights

- Participants get-together with friends, peers or family to the restaurant on average 3-4 times per month.
- Most participant's claim to have pain-points mostly when finding seats, choosing dishes and about payment process.
- 75% of participant stated they fees disturbed by the paper review.
- 60% of participants said they needed a food recommendation platform or heard some reviews from other customers.
- Most participant will be very happy when receiving gifts or coupons from the restaurant and willing to come back.

### Ideate Phase

In this phase, let's 'think outside the box' to identify new solutions. And we will start generating ideas. Our primary focus is about the quantity, not the quality of the ideas.

#### User Flow

A user flow represents the path taken by users complete tasks. It takes them from their entry point through a set of steps towards a successful outcome and final action, such as purchasing a product.

**Flow:** Splash Screen → Onboarding → Login Options → Home Screen, etc.

## Design System

A design system is a collection of reusable components that is guided by clear standards that allow the cohesive assembly of variable amounts of applications.

### Branding

We used the "overt green" **#95AE45** as the branding color. It represents the attribute of food and restaurant; and brings a sense of warmth, optimism & personal health motivation. Letter "L" represents to our restaurant name "Lavu's" and the seat in the restaurant. Curved lines bring a sense of comfort and luxury like the way customers enjoy the food in our restaurant.

#### Logo Variants

- **Primary Logo:** Green icon 'L' + Green text 'LAVU'S Restaurant'
- **Secondary Logo:** Black icon 'L' + Black text 'LAVU'S Restaurant'
- **Branding Ranking Icons:** Chair 'L' icon with 1, 2, and 3 stars
